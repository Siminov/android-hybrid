Using Service Descriptor you can describe the structure of your RESTful Web Service API. To declare your service descriptor, you have to create a service descriptor file in your application assets folder and add the same in your application descriptor too.

```xml

    <service-descriptors>
	
            <!-- Service Descriptor -->
        <service-descriptor>full_path_of_service_descriptor</service-descriptor>

    </service-descriptors>

```

See the service descriptor element reference in Configuration section for more information about declaring your service.
