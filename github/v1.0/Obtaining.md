#### Release Bundle Downloads

The Siminov Framework team provide release bundles hosted at **Github** File Release System, in ZIP and TGZ formats. Each release bundle contains Build Files, Documentation, Source Code, and other goodness.

You can download releases of Siminov Framework, in your chosen format, from the list at [Builds](http://siminov.com/build.html).

> Note: If you want to build only native based application then you need only Core or Connect, no need to include Web in your app.
