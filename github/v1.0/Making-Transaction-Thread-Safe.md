## Making Transaction Thread Safe

By default any transaction executed on database is not thread safe, android provides API to make all transaction thread-safe by using locks around critical sections. This is pretty expensive, so if you know that your DB will only be used by a single thread then you should not use this in your application.

#### Android API: Transaction Thread Safe

```java

    public void setTransactionSafe(boolean isTransactionSafe);

```

#### iOS API: Transaction Thread Safe

```objective-c

    - (void)setTransactionSafe:(bool)isTransactionSafe;

```


#### Windows API: Transaction Thread Safe

```c#

    public void SetTransactionSafe(bool isTransactionSafe);

```


Configuring transaction thread-safe in siminov. To enable/disable transaction thread-safe in Core you have to use property is locking required defined in DatabaseDescriptor.si.xml file.
