A web application, by definition is derived from a combination of technologies, approaches or elements of different kinds. With respect to mobile applications, a web application leverages best of both native and mobile web technologies. 

In web environment, it is very difficult to handle database and web service calls. Siminov makes application developer life easy by mapping **JavaScript/Native model objects (Android - Java | iOS - Objective C | Windows - C#)** to relational database and handling all web service calls using the native container capability.

> Note: While having a strong background in SQL and Web Service is not required to use Siminov Framework, having a basic understanding of the concepts can greatly help you understand Siminov more fully and quickly. Probably the single best background is an understanding of data modeling and web service principles. You might want to consider these resources as a good starting point: [Data Modeling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_modeling) and [Representational State Transfer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer).

Siminov Web Framework is a combination of Core and Connect Framework which handles both database and web service calls. 

- **Database**: Siminov not only takes care of the mapping from JavaScript/Native model classes to database tables (and from JavaScript/Native model data types to SQL data types), but also provides data query and retrieval facilities. It can significantly reduce development time otherwise spent with manual data handling in SQLite. Siminov design goal is to relieve the developer from 99\% of common data persistence-related programming tasks by eliminating the need for manual, hand-crafted data processing using SQLite. However, unlike many other persistence solutions, Siminov does not hide the power of SQLite from you and guarantees that your investment in relational technology and knowledge is as valid as always.

- **Web Service**: Siminov is a lightweight, comprehensive, open source RESTful web API framework for the **Java - Android, Objective C - iOS and C \# - Windows** platform. It supports major internet transport, data format, and service descriptor standards like **HTTP and HTTPS, SMTP, XML, JSON, Atom, and WADL**.
