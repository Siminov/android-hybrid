<!-- 

ApplicationDescriptor.si.xml is the one who connects application to SIMINOV. It contains properties which defines the behaviour of application.

Application Descriptor Elements: 
	
	i. General Properties About Application.
		
		-> name* : Name of application. It is mandatory field. If any resources created by application then it will be under folder named on it.
		
		-> description: Description of application. It is optional field.

		-> version: Version of application. It is mandatory field. Default is 0.0.
		

				
	ii. Database Descriptor Paths Used In Application 
			- Path of all database descriptor's used in application.
			- Every database descriptor has its own database object.


	iii. Service Descriptor Paths Used In Application
		- Path of all service descriptor's used in application.


	iv. Sync Descriptor Paths Used In Application
		- Path of all sync descriptor's used in application.


	v. Notification Descriptor Properties: Push notifications let your application notify a user of new messages or events even when the user is not actively using your application.
			When the user taps the notification, they are sent to your application.
		
			PROPERTIES: 
	
	
	vi.	Adapter Descriptors Used In Application
		- Full path of application descriptor used in the application.
		- Every adapter descriptor has its own adapter path.
		


	vii. Library Descriptors Used In Application
			- Full path of library descriptor used in the application.
			- Every library descriptor has its own library path.
	
	
	viii. Event Handlers Implemented By Application.
		- SIMINOV FRAMEWORK provides below type of event handlers
	
			-> ISiminovEvents: It contain events associated with life cycle of SIMINOV.
				such as (OnSiminovInitialized, OnFirstTimeSiminovInitialized, OnSiminovStoped).
	
		
			-> IDatabaseEvents: It contain events associated with database operations.
				such as (OnDatabaseCreated, OnDatabaseDroped, OnTableCreated, OnTableDroped, OnIndexCreated).

			-> ISyncEvents: It contain events associated with sync operations.
				such as (OnStart, OnQueue, OnFinish, OnTerminate)
			
			-> INotificationEvents: It contain events associated with notification.
				such as (OnRegistration, OnUnregistration, OnNotification, OnError)
				
		- Application can have implementation of this event listeners.
